This is a quick little project that I wanted to try out. I had never really used API's with C# before so I decided to do this to learn about connecting and consuming REST API's with C# and also to try some advanced designing with WPF.

## Things Used
* Material Design XAML
* TMdb API
* C# Behaviours
